    "How does this work?\n",

    "DFS of a graph produces a single tree \n",
    "    if all vertices are reachable from the DFS starting point.\n",
    "Otherwise \n",
    "    DFS produces a forest. \n",
    "    \n",
    "So DFS of a graph with only one SCC always produces a tree. \n",
    "The important point to note is DFS may produce a tree or a forest \n",
    "    when there are more than one SCCs depending upon the chosen starting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the above diagram, \n",
    "    if we start DFS from vertices 0 or 1 or 2, \n",
    "        we get a tree as output.\n",
    "    And if we start from 3 or 4, \n",
    "        we get a forest. \n",
    "To find and print all SCCs, \n",
    "    we would want to start DFS from vertex 4 (which is a sink vertex),\n",
    "        then move to 3 which is sink in the remaining set (set excluding 4) \n",
    "           and finally any of the remaining vertices (0, 1, 2). \n",
    "           \n",
    "So how do we find this sequence of picking vertices as starting points of DFS? \n",
    "Unfortunately, \n",
    "    there is no direct way for getting this sequence. \n",
    "    However, if we do a DFS of graph and store vertices according to their finish times,\n",
    "        we make sure that the finish time of a vertex that connects to other SCCs (other that its own SCC),\n",
    "            will always be greater than finish time of vertices in the other SCC (See this for proof). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in DFS of above example graph, \n",
    "    finish time of 0 is always greater than 3 and 4 (irrespective of the sequence of vertices considered for DFS). \n",
    "    And finish time of 3 is always greater than 4. DFS doesn’t guarantee about other vertices, \n",
    "    \n",
    "for example finish times of 1 and 2 may be smaller or greater than 3 and 4 depending upon the sequence of vertices considered for DFS. \n",
    "So to use this property, we do DFS traversal of complete graph and push every finished vertex to a stack.\n",
    "In stack, 3 always appears after 4, and 0 appear after both 3 and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next step,\n",
    "    we reverse the graph.\n",
    "Consider the graph of SCCs.\n",
    "    In the reversed graph, \n",
    "        the edges that connect two components are reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the SCC {0, 1, 2} becomes sink and the SCC {4} becomes source. \n",
    "    As discussed above,\n",
    "        in stack, we always have 0 before 3 and 4.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    So if we do a DFS of the reversed graph using sequence of vertices in stack, \n",
    "        we process vertices from sink to source (in reversed graph). \n",
